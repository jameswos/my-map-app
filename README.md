### My Local Map Project!

The last project to complete Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree! Yay!

### Instructions to use / contribute

1. Download or clone this repo
2. Install all dependencies with 'npm install'
3. Start the development server with 'npm start'

### Caching and the Service Worker

'create-react-app' comes with a built-in service worker, although it is only available in production mode. To work in production mode run 'npm run build' - this will create a build version of the app that caches the page and renders visited pages even when there is no network access

### 3rd Party Data & dependencies

- Google Maps API
- Foursquare API
- 'create-react-app'
- 'escape-string-regexp'
- 'axios'
